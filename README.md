My videogame for Ludum Dare #56, with theme of "Tiny creatures."

You were called for a cleanup of tiny creatures in the castle walls. Are you up to the task? 

# How to play

Walk into arena and survive! Collect health bonuses and more guns in order to defend against more and more aggressive tiny creatures!

Web version is available, but I highly recommend downloading a Windows version and playing that instead. I assumed that Godot 4.3 would be as web capable as 3.6, where I never ran into any issues, but it seems like this is not the case. 

I spent a non-significant amount of Sunday trying to find every possible way how to optimise the game for web and sacrificed a very big chunk of plans, but no matter what I tried, I didn't get rid of the issue where after around 3 or 4 minutes of playing in areana, all 3D objects visually disappear. 

Therefore, if you want to get a taste of this game, go ahead, but if you want to give creatures a proper hell, local version got your back. :smile:

# Commentary

This is the first time I used Godot 4+ for the game jam, I was always using 3.X before due to better web exporters. This project went amazing all the way to the first web export, which I did way too late. Would there be no web issues, this game would be much bigger - I had 4 different arenas planned with dynamic doors and endless mode at the end. 
However, once I exported this to web, then I ran into the first issue - I couldn't see anything. This got thankfully resolved by the different compression method, but the other issue I couldn't resolve - when there are too many nodes, all 3D objects just disappear. I cut the scope massively due to this in a futile effort to optimise it so that there are as few nodes as possible. I implemented the enemy limit so that spawners do not spawn over the certain number creatures, I optimised ground and walls massively, but nothing helped. Due to this, I am kinda disappointed, because this could have been much bigger. That said, it's still fun, but I recommend downloading a local version.
